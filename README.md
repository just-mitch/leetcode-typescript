# Welcome!

This repo serves as a typescript companion to [my go version](https://github.com/just-mitch/leetcode-go).

It serves as a place to solve leetcode problems, implement data structures and design patterns, and more.

I'm using the bun runtime since it's not production.

# Installation

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
